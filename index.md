The official website for the GeekHacks community.

## TL;DR

Geekhacks events are inspired by hackathons but intended to be smaller in size, less formal and most importantly very easy to setup and run. The name geekhacks 
is a derivative of [geekdrinks](geekdrinks.org), a regularly occuring social event I created for a curated list of smart and creative individuals I have met over
the years.
